He added that he's \"not exactly sure I would encourage people to run out right now and buy cryptocurrency,\" since the technology's use as a long-term store of value has yet to be proven.\nBitcoin shares with gold several strengths and weaknesses as an asset class, and could conceivably replace it as a store of value eventually, he said.\nThiel said he was \"very proud to have supported Hulk Hogan in his lawsuit,\" against Gawker , saying that he had seen the now defunct news organization bully and mistreat people for a long time. Privacy still matters in the digital age, he said, though the question of what it is and how to protect it is as much a legal, social, and political question as a technological one.\nHe also drew parallels between how the Democrats are now treating President Trump and how the Republicans treated President Obama during his two terms â€” painting him in such an absurd way that they will turn off much of the electorate and thus assist in his re-election. He also speculated that many media personalities and late-night comedians were privately hoping for another Trump victory, as his first term so far has been excellent for TV ratings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T20:16:02.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
