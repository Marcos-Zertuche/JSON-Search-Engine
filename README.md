# JSON Search Engine
## Overview
This JSON Search Engine is built to compile a library of JSON Documents via user inputs, and allow the user to perform a search that replicates a normal search engine through the terminal. The user can search words, people, and organizations, and also has the ability to omit words from the search. The results are returned in order by relativity score, prioritizing persons and organizations determined by users, followed by frequency of search words in the body of the JSON Document.

## How it works:
First, the user will run ``./supersearch /<folder-containing-JSON-files>`
